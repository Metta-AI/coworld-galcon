' Local 16-player preview: distance rows initialize across ticks; pair IDs use stride 17.
' Veles v5 - v2 without the 25% margin on enemy-owned targets
' base.bas: v5 plus an open-chat truce protocol. In the opening (ticks 64-960) a bot
' that sees an enemy's planet next to its own asks "<Color> truce?" once per player in
' global chat; every bot keeps a table of who is in a truce with whom from that chat, so a
' bot that already has a partner is not asked again; a bot with no truce answers
' "yes <Color>" (else "no <Color>"); partners never attack each other; a partner that
' takes one of your planets is a breaker, announced as "<Color> broke truce", and every
' bot that hears it attacks the breaker; a truce ends when only the two partners are left.
' Each ready planet keeps a garrison that covers the largest attack an enemy
' neighbour can throw (three quarters of its stock, the Classic rule), then
' pays for the cheapest productive target it can take outright, counting
' the defender growth during the flight; surplus with no affordable target
' walks to the own planet nearest the enemy.
